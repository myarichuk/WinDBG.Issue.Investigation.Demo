1) Download either
* WinDBG Preview from Windows Store - performance of this WinDBG is preferrable
* Windows SDK (Windows 10 SDK if you have Windows 10). Make sure to install "Windows Debugging Tools" - 
this will install "old" WinDBG

2) Configure symbols:
We need to configure from where symbols would be download by the WinDBG. 
The idea here is to provide Microsoft server for OS level APIs, then provide local cache.
If you do not see *YOUR* code in stack traces, you should make sure to place all PDBs in the same folder as the memory dump. 
Note that PDBs of your code need to be from EXACTLY the same version as the assemblies/executables you are debugging, otherwise
symbol loading would not work.
* WinDBG Preview: File -> Settings -> Debugging Settings -> Symbols Path
* "Old" WinDBG: File -> File Symbol Path

3) Enter the following at the "symbols" text box:
c:\symbols
cache*c:\symbols
SRV*c:\symbols*http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols
