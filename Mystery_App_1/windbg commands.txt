1) take a multiple full-dumps via Process Explorer
2) open the dump and execute commands in windbg:
 * .loadby sos coreclr
 * .load [path to sosex dll]\sosex
 * !dlk (this is a sosex command, and it won't work on a mini-dump)
 * notice the id of CLR threads, then execute !threads
 * use OSID of threads involved in the deadlock and execute ~[OSID]s, then !clrstack. Do it for both threads and notice the stack trace
