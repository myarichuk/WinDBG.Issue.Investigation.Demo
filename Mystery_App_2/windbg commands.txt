1) take multiple mini-dumps via Process Explorer
2) open each mini-dump and execute commands in windbg:
 * .loadby sos coreclr -> initialize SOS commands so we can analyze .Net memory dump
 * !eestack -ee -> show managed stack traces of current threads (IF they are managed threads)

 if you load SOSEX, you can use MethodDesc address (method description) 
 to disassemble the suspect method -> use the SOSEX command !muf [address]
 This way it is possible to see what code is doing even if no sources are available...
